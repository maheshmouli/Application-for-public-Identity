# Application-for-public-Identity
In this I created a common platform for applying public identity like PAN card, Voter ID and Driving License. It reduces the paper work done by the authority and applicant. First user need to Register in the website as authorised user and by using login credentials he can login and apply for his/her requirements. After submitting the required documents for the identity user will get a confirmation mail about the application. Admin can see the documents provided and confirm for the identity, then user will get the status of the application.
